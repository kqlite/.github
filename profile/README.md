## *kqlite*

**Lightweight remote SQLite with high availability and automatic failover.**

Remote accees to **SQLite** is done via the **PostgreSQL** wire protocol.<br>
**High availability** is easy to setup and needs only two Nodes (Primary->Secondary).<br>

It's a solution for applications that require **High Availability** but don't need all the features of a complete RDBMS and can fit **SQLite** in their use case.<br>
Also ***kqlite*** can be considered to be used as a lightweight storage backend for **K8s** (https://docs.k3s.io/datastore) and the **Edge**.<br>
